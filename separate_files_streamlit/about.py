    I'm a Doctoral Researcher at the [Interdisciplinary Institute for Societal Computing](https://www.i2sc.net) at 
    [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html), advised by [Prof. Ingmar Weber](https://ingmarweber.de), 
    where I dive into the fascinating (and sometimes dark) intersections of society and the digital world.

    My research sheds light on the hidden, overlooked, and often unsettling aspects of socio-political and online harms—
    because what happens in the digital sphere doesn’t just stay online; it shapes our realities.
    Beyond this, I am deeply interested in understanding human behavior—particularly the motivations and patterns that shape online interactions.

    When I’m not unraveling the digital traces of human nature, you can find me deep in a book, overanalyzing a random internet trend, 
    or wondering how we all got here (digitally and existentially).
